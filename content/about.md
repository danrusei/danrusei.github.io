**About Me**

I have led engineering and operational teams focusing on the professional growth and performance excellence of the engineers, ensuring on-time and on-scope delivery of led projects. In my current role, Iâ€™m leading an engineering team (software developers & SREs) focusing on delivery of performant and feature-rich applications.  

I have a keen interest in cloud-native architectures, distributed systems over Public Cloud, and programming (especially **GO** & **Rust**), and I'm always seeking to learn new technologies.

Last but not least, I like sharing information about the technologies I learn or use within my projects.
